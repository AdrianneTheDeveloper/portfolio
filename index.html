                    Hi! I'm Adrianne. I am a Houston-based full-stack software engineer. 
                    I build web applications. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-me">
                <p>
                    I started my coding journey as a student studying English. 
                    The path I was on couldn't be further away from the huge world of tech.
                    My interest is technology began to pique when I wanted to game on my Chromebook. 
                    I was introduced to the Linux Dev Environment and fell in love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then my passion in building, maintaining, and designing amazing applications has only grown.
                    I am also an artist by hobby. These two traits fuel by drive to have apps jam-packed with creativity and show my passion.
                    I also strive to create things that are highly accessible to all.
                </p>
